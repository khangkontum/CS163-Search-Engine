Celtics guard Kyrie Irving missed the entire postseason due to knee surgery, but he managed to find his way onto Panamas World Cup roster.

OK, not really.

Panama midfielder Gabriel Gomez has a striking resemblance with the Celtics guard, and the beard certainly helps. When Panama took on Belgium for the nations first-ever World Cup match on Monday, many soccer fans caught glimpse of Irvings lookalike.

Twitter went on to have plenty of fun with the moment.
