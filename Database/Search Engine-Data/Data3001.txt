PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds Leaves Early Access With Tons of New Features
PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds has been the most absurdly successful game in recent memory, and whats even more ridiculous is that it redefined the gaming landscape all within the confines of Early Access. But today, the impossibly popular battle royale has finally hit version 1.0, and that update marks more than just a marketable version number. By now, you know what PUBG is all about  100 players jump out of a plane and scrounge a battlefield for supplies in a winner-takes-all quest for a chicken dinner. Heres whats new on the official release day.
The biggest addition is the new desert map, Miramar, which offers a completely different feel from the original Erangel, complete with new weapons, new vehicles, and new ways to kill or be killed. You can feel the games success here, too, since Miramar features far more detailed locations, with unique churches, arenas, and massive cities to do battle in.
But whatever map youre fighting on, youll be able to take advantage of vaulting, which gives the seemingly obvious ability to climb over things. Small fence? Step over it. Big fence? Pull yourself over it. Window? Blast through that pane of glass to get the drop on enemies hiding inside. Vaulting makes it far easier to get around, lets you quickly climb up vertical locations you couldnt reach before, and allows you to make deadlier ambushes and more daring escapes.
Then theres the killcam, which finally lets you see what you did wrong and how you got taken down at the end of a match. Even bigger is the replay system, which records a massive chunk of the map around you with full timeline controls and free camera look, letting you either check out how nearby combatants are playing or string together your own in-game movies.
And those are just the big features that have recently come over from the test server. Over the course of Early Access, PUBG has seen constant rebalances and tweaks, ranging from minor changes to the loot tables to full-on new weapons like the Groza and Mini 14  not to mention a long line of performance improvements. Theres even a full new game mode that fully locks you to the first-person perspective for the most immersive experience possible.
Heres what PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds looks like in action:
PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds is available now on Steam, and dont think the updates are done just because the games gone 1.0  theres plenty more in store, including an option to choose what map youre jumping into at the start of a game.
