Owners of Ford F-series trucks  the most popular vehicle in 2017  will pay about $413 more in gas this year compared to last year, according to government estimates. Honda Civic and Toyota Camry drivers, meanwhile, will face increases of $206.
Those figures are based on the Energy Information Administrations estimatethat gas will cost an average of $2.79 a gallon in 2018, up 37 cents from last years average. The calculation also assumes youre doing as much driving as the average American  about 13,000 miles a year.
Gas prices jumped 1.7 percent in May alone, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, outpacing an increase of 0.2 percent across all consumer goods.
The rise is due to increasing demand and reduced oil production by OPEC member countries. Some also blame President Trumps withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, through prices were already on the rise when he announced the move.
At $2.92 per gallon nationwide, gas currently costs more than the EIAs year-long estimate. Prices tend to peak around Memorial Day, then dip for the rest of the year. Still, the current gas prices are at their highest point since 2014, when gas averaged $3.36 a gallon nationwide, amid instability in Iraq.

Akbar Al Baker, the chief executive of Qatar Airways, has come under fire for telling a press conference in Sydney, Australia, that only a man could do his job because it is so difficult.
When asked about what could be done to increase the poor representation of women in the Middle Easts aviation industry, Al Baker replied that Qatar Airways has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position, Bloomberg reports. His comments were reportedly met with load groans of disapproval.
After the press conference, which was connected to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)s annual meeting, Al Baker clarified to Bloomberg Televisions Haidi Lun that he was only referring to one individual and not referring to the staff in general. He also claimed that there was no gender inequality at Qatar Airways and said the carriers staff is more than 33% female.
Al Bakers comments came the day it was announced that he was commencing a one-year term as chairman of the IATA Board of Governors, succeeding Goh Choon Phong, the CEO of Singapore Airlines. He was named Qatar Airways Group chief executive in 1997.
According to the IATA Board of Governors website, of 30 members, just two are women: Mara Jos Hidalgo Gutirrez, Chief Executive Officer of Air Europa, and Christine Ourmires-Widener, Chief Executive Officer of Flybe Limited. This is part of the reason why Bloomberg has described the IATA as a boys club.
