California Sen. Kamala Harris is taking a prosecutors case straight at President Donald Trump as she campaigns in South Carolina.

The former local district attorney and state attorney general told thousands at the South Carolina Democratic Party convention on Saturday that Trump has a long rap sheet that Democrats 2020 nominee must be able to use against him in a general election.

She hammered Trump for everything from tax policy benefiting the rich and trade policies hurting farmers to a lack of civil rights protections for marginalized Americans.

Harris added that Democrats shouldnt turn back the clock and instead start the next chapter.

She never mentioned Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, but her spirited speech seemed to attack the former vice presidents argument that hes the Democrat with the best shot to defeat the president.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg is telling South Carolina Democrats that his city will recover from the racial wounds exposed after a South Bend police officer shot and killed a black man last week.

Buttigieg told a large crowd, including hundreds of black voters, that South Bend, Indiana, is full of people who believe in safety and justice. He said an independent investigation of the incident will help the city become stronger in the broken places.

The mayor spoke at the South Carolina Democratic Convention a day after being jeered and protested in his home city.

Buttigiegs relationship with black South Bend residents has gotten more scrutiny in recent months. Black voters historically cast more than half of South Carolinas presidential primary ballots.
