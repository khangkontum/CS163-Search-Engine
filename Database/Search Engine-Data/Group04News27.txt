Presentation on NCBIs genome browser at Rocky Mountain Genomics Hackcon
On June 18, 2019, NCBIs Sanjida Rangwala will demonstrate the rich data visualization capabilities of NCBIs genome browser at a conference that is part of the Rocky Mountain Genomics Hackcon.  As mentioned in a previous post, NCBI staff will also participate in an NCBI-style Hackathon  as part of the larger event.  The genome browser presentation and demonstration will show you how to create visuals that provide insights and show connections among genes, transcripts, variation,  epigenomics and GWAS data from NCBI sources. You will also see  how you can upload your own data and embed NCBI viewers on your own pages.
