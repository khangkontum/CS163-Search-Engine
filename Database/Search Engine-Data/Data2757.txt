While we already knew about the Poke Ball Plus, a Joy-Con controller for Nintendo Switch thats due to be released alongside Pokemon Lets Go Pikachu and Eevee, Nintendo announced during its E3 presentation that every Poke Ball will come with an exclusive Pokemon: The legendary Mew.
While the controller can be used to play the Pokemon Lets Go games, it can also be used to store a Pokemon from those games and carried around with you, and youll earn rewards when you do. This is similar to the Pokewalker pedometer accessory from Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver.
Each Poke Ball Plus will come with a Mew already stored on the device. As far as we know so far, this is the only way to get Mew in Pokemon Lets Go--Nintendo America President Reggie Fils-Aime mentioned that Mew was exclusive to Poke Ball Plus. However, the Lets Go games will allow you to transfer Pokemon users have caught in mobile game Pokemon Go, so it remains to be seen whether you can do the same with Mew.
Pokemon Lets Go Pikachu and Eevee, along with the Poke Ball Plus controller, are due for release on November 16.
