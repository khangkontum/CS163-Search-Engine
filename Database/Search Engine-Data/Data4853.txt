Never happening, Crane said during a Wednesday Emmy panel in a video posted online by the outlet. Never, never. No. We did it, its done.

Rachel Bloom of the CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend soon asked Crane about some of the shows famous couples. 

Doesnt have to be canon, she said. But in your opinion - Ross and Rachel: how they doin? Are they still together? Do you - do you think thats sustainable?
Yeah, yeah, Crane confirmed of the characters played by David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston.

He added, Come, on, come on. They worked really hard - ten years - yeah.

But that wasnt all, Friends fans.

Monica and Chandler, still good? Bloom asked, referencing the married couple played by Courtney Cox and Matthew Perry.

Absolutely, Crane said, before arguing thats why you dont want to see any more of it, cause its all a happy ending.
