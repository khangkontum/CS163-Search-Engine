Kirin J Callinan on stunts, exhibitionism and being misunderstood: Is this who I want to be?
After having all his equipment stolen in the US last month, Kirin J Callinan printed up some new merchandise as a fundraiser. One T-shirt reads: What part of Kirin J Callinan dont you understand?

Every part, he confirms dryly to Guardian Australia.

The Sydney musician has had a contradictory and confusing year of mistakes, exaggeration and misrepresentations  thats what it says in the press release for his third solo album, Return to Center. But today hes committed to clearing a few things up in the name of transparency  an unusual step for an artist assumed to be rooted in provocation and parody.

Events kicked off in November 2017, when Callinan lifted his kilt to photographers at the Aria awards in Sydney, and subsequently received a good behaviour bond after pleading guilty to obscene and wilful exposure. His referees for the case included Jimmy Barnes, director Jane Campion and Neil Finn, who described him as as a person with a penchant for mischief and exhibitionism.

(Its true, I did shoot fairly high with my referees, Callinan says now.)

Finn wasnt wrong; the exhibitionism wasnt exactly out of character. Callinans penis, or at times just the fluids that emerge from it  has made cameos on his Instagram account, in the video of SAD and on the gatefold of the vinyl of his second album, 2017s Bravado. But when the exposure moved from the artists own domain to a red carpet surprise, it raised questions  and concerns  around consent.

Further criticism blew up around that gatefold sleeve, in which he was photographed painted bronze  like a bodybuilder homage, the idea of vanity, he says now. But in the context of recent and overdue discourse about blackface (as well as consent), to many it seemed Callinan was unforgivably thumbing his nose. Opinion pieces by Australian cultural commentators followed, and his appearances at touring festival Laneway were cancelled  partly at the urging of Miss Blanks, rapper and ambassador of the festivals safe space initiative.

In fact, in Australia, he seemed to be cancelled in general.

At the time, Callinan followed advice to pipe down and let the conversation happen around him, but hes now using Return to Center  an album of cover versions  to belatedly explain himself. It was also a very good way for me to look at myself and look at my behaviour and think, Is this who I want to be? he says.

The album opens with Life Is Life  the Laibach version, not the Opus original. This is significant because Laibach, a Slovenian avant-garde group formed in 1980, perform absurd pomp-rock straight-faced and employ deeply controversial imagery. Often, their intentions are confusing.

Similarly, Callinan is of the opinion that art should be amoral and a conversation starter, if nothing else. When asked if he has a leave-it-to-the-gods attitude with some of his performance-art stunts, he replies, Yeah, exactly that. And its both liberating and anxiety-inducing. You suffer the consequences.

 It was easier, as a performer in the age of social media, to betray my own intelligence for a cheap like ... It came back to bite me
He addresses those consequences head-on with some of his song choices. A cover of Rise, by Public Image Limited (originally written about apartheid in South Africa), is introduced by actors reading out news reports such as: An error of judgement, a Sydney courts been told. Thats what prompted a Sydney musician to flash himself on the Arias red carpet. Then come the lyrics of the first verse: I could be wrong, I could be right and  oh dear  I could be black, I could be white 

Then theres The Homosexual, by Momus, which seems to address criticism that Callinans flirtation with cross-dressing and queer imagery is purely to titillate. His aesthetic has pinballed from homoerotic cowboy, to a John Waters pencil-moustache and floral tops, to high-waisted pants and 80s pastels  although most recently hes been toying with a chainmail coif.

To this, he says, Ive been dressing very flamboyantly since I was a teenager and was called a faggot growing up, got beaten up. The idea of being non-binary or fluid wasnt an option that existed to me, but Im sure if I was 10 years younger I probably would identify as that.

Callinan grew up in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, though his vibe is more Newtown meets Snowtown. His father was a founding member of the Radiators, and Callinans own band comprises his brothers, known as Tex Crick and Mahne Frame, with guest artists.

He now lives in Highland Park, northeast Los Angeles. The American media has been fairly immune to the controversy in Australia (although Spin did ask Is his brand of provocation the most interesting thing in underground music, or just nonsense? before settling favourably), preferring to focus on the fact that Callinan audaciously took advantage of US chain store Guitar Centers return policy to record the album entirely with free equipment. He even borrowed the companys branding for the album artwork.

If anything, Im celebrating with them, he says, trying on that idea like a new coif. It would be the ultimate return to center if they see it that way and stock my record and I do in-store performances. Or theyre going to sue me  and that wouldnt be bad either, to be honest.

As well as being a pun on Guitar Centers returns policy, the album title refers to Callinans intention to tone down the bravado  which, he says, was a reaction to wearing his heart on his sleeve so much in his earlier years. Somehow that vulnerability morphed into playing an outrageous character, he says, without that really being the intention.

It was easier, as a performer in the age of social media, to betray my own intelligence all the time for a cheap like or two, playing into the vacuum a bit, he says. It came back to bite me, if I can speak candidly. I think some of the reactions that Ive had on some moral or political grounds have largely come from people being annoyed by my obnoxiousness or my willingness to do dumb things without recourse, when they expected better from me. So when, if, I fucked up, I wasnt given much grace or shown much mercy.

In Australia, Callinans rather stuck between a rock and a hard place. Just as there are those early fans, he suspects, who feel let down by the art pranks he embarked on, there are more recent fans who will feel betrayed by words of contrition. It explains why he was so drawn to one more cover on the album, Robert Wyatts Signed Curtain, with its dispiriting acknowledgement that composing a song in order to connect can be a wasted effort.

I found that so heartbreaking, says Callinan, the idea that I would be so hellbent on getting someones affection  or collective affection  that I would form a band and record this song and sing it with all my heart, only to admit that this is futile.

But that, surely, is the essence of every songwriter, the desire to be understood.

Totally, he says. But few admit their failings and Robert Wyatt just admits that, actually, this is all bullshit. Im sorry.
