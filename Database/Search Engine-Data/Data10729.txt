Deandre Ayton walked onto the Arizona Wildcats charter flight and immediately was greeted by boosters and fans.

Hey, Deandre, have a good weekend, a booster said.

Ayton looked at him quizzically.

I dont know who you are talking about, this Deandre, he said with a Spanish lilt. Im Alejandro.

Wait. You didnt know Alejandro was Aytons alter ego? Well, then you should probably meet Josh, too.

Well be sitting on a plane and if things are quiet hell start talking in his Josh voice, said Jeff Dean, Arizona basketball public address announcer. Josh is a middle-aged yuppie White guy who talks about fun family vacations they went on in the 1980s.

Deandre Ayton isnt just the presumptive No. 1 pick in the June 21 draft, the player Phoenix hopes will lead its franchise out of the dark ages. Hes a 19-year-old kid who doesnt know why everybody has to be so serious all the time.

Hes just a joyful person, former UA teammate Rawle Alkins said. Hes the type of person when he sees a vibe thats down or sad hell try to pick it up.

To do that, sometimes Josh or Alejandro make an appearance.
When I was younger I watched Spiderman and they had the Green Goblin and before the Green Goblin died he told Spiderman that it wasnt him, it was the Green Goblin that was killing all those people, Ayton said. I thought, Hmm, I should try to change my personality sometimes when it comes to interviews. 

Ayton then breaks into Alejandros voice  Alejandro is from Venezuela, by the way  before seamlessly affecting Joshs articulate language.

I wouldnt say he has split personalities, Wildcats guard Allonzo Trier said. But theres layers to Deandre depending on how well you get to know him.
