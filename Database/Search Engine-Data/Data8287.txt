County officials defend Forest Preserves police in wake of man harassing woman over Puerto Rican flag shirt
In the wake of a man berating a woman for wearing a Puerto Rican flag T-shirt at a forest preserve, Cook County officials repeatedly have reassured people that the serene expanses of woods are a safe place to go.As part of that effort, theyve cited the work of Forest Preserves police, saying the response of an officer who appeared to ignore a womans request for help shouldnt reflect poorly on the entire department.The appalling incident of June 14 and the inaction of one former member of the Forest Preserves Police should not diminish the greatness of the preserves, nor dissuade people from enjoying our 70,000 acres of nature and beauty, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said in a statement Thursday.But the incident that erupted into a national story this week via a viral video posted online isn't the first time the Forest Preserve District Police Department has come under scrutiny, and its renewed questions about whether the police force is necessary. Some critics say the department is a redundant use of taxpayer funds and question whether its duties should be taken over by Cook County Sheriff Tom Darts office.During a budget fight last October after the countys controversial soda pop tax was repealed, Dart said he could absorb the police forces responsibilities with minimal if any expansion of his ranks, reducing taxpayer costs by $9.5 million.That sparked a sharp rebuke from the districts leadership, and the change wasnt made.We need a dedicated force to be out in the forest preserves every day dealing with all issues, big and small, to make sure we can do our jobs and people feel safe and are safe, Forest Preserves General Superintendent Arnold Randall said at a Thursday news conference responding to the incident. Having a force thatll come to you when you need us, maybe, but if theres some other priority, theres something else thats happening outside the forest preserve and were a second option does not work for our mission.If another department took over responsibilities for their jurisdiction, the forest preserves would be less of a priority compared with more serious crimes, and that would affect services, Randall said. If people dont feel safe, he said, people wont come.
When youre talking about an individual incident here, I would say its important not to cast that broad negative shadow across every forest preserve officer whos out there working every day, dealing with huge crowds, dealing with people who are intoxicated, dealing with all sorts of issues big and small, Randall said.
