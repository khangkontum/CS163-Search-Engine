Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner last played an NBA game in March in a Game 7 playoffs loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Since then, hes apparently put in some time at the gym:
WHOA. Myles Turner is CUT. He was one of those players that already looked big at 255 pounds. And theres a lot of work to do? Pacers fans probably cant wait to see what he looks like by October.
